<h2>Cornell University<br>
  ECE 5760 <br>
  Overview and Policy</h2>
<br clear=left>
</center>

<p><b>Suggested  course</b>:	
  <br>
ECE 5725 will be useful for students taking this course<br>
More specifically, you need to know: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Digital design using synthesizable Verilog </li>
  <li>Linux on ARM, with some low-level memory mapping</li>
  <li>C programming (Linux IPC, POSIX threads, UDP)</li>
  <li>Some electronic construction </li>
  <li>Ablity to find and read complex hardware/software data sheets.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><strong>This course <em>may be</em> restricted only to MEng students</strong>.</b></p>
<p><b>Reading<br>
  </b>We will 
expect you to become completely familiar with a large amount of detailed FPGA, ARM, and LINUX information from Altera and other sources.  <br>
You will have to find, read, and apply appropriate information.<p> <b>Purpose</b> <br>
  The purpose of this course is to enable its students to carry out sophisticated 
  designs of   digital systems using system-on-programmable-chip (SOPC) techniques, along with a variety of digital and analog interface technologies to build complex devices. 
<p> <i><font color="#000000"><b>This course is a design course. </b></font></i>This 
  means that we will expect you to show considerable creativity, flexibility, 
  and motivation. <br>
  In particular you will need to:
<ul>
  <li>Hit the web  to find your own answers to questions 
    you have.</li>
  <li>Read and understand every aspect of manufacturer's data sheets for a variety 
    of devices.</li>
  <li>Use material from many of the courses you have taken. </li>
  <li><i><font color="#FF0000">Find solutions on your own from general, incomplete specifications.</font></i> 
    The lab assignments will be open-ended. Clever, 
    efficient solutions will be rewarded.  
  Detailed designs must be generated by the student teams <em>before they get to lab</em>. Designs will typically 
  include C language code, digital circuitry designed in Verilog, and use of digital and analog peripherals.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<b>Course Work</b>  
<p> There will be lab assignments and a final project. 
<p> The course grade will be calculated as follows: 
<ul>
  <li>50% labratory assignments 
    <ul>
      <li>Ask lots of questions, read the material, and write code before lab. You are expected to be familiar with the assignment before coming to lab. 
  Roughly 20%<b></b> of your lab grade depends upon two weekly lab checkpoints. Another 30% depends on the quality, quantity and character of the lab exercise demonstration. The remaining 50% will be based on your lab writeup. The same ratios (20, 30, 50%) are used to evaluate the final project. 
      <li>Lab writeups are due at the <b> night before</b> the next lab period at 2300.<li>No late writeups will be accepted without prior permission. <br>
        (Except for sickness or family emergency) 
      <li><b>A late writeup receives a ZERO grade</b>. 
      <li>Laboratory work will be done in groups of two or three where, of course, collaboration 
        is encouraged between members of the group. You will turn in one report per team. No written collaboration between groups 
      is permitted. You are (of course) encouraged to help anyone in lab.      
    </ul>
  
  <li>50% for the final project. Final project grades will be assigned by rank-ordering all projects in all sections, thus you will be competing against everyone in the class for this grade.
This means that staff will <strong>not</strong> be able to estimate your grade on this project until all projects are finished and handed in.  
  <li>If you feel that you have been unfairly graded, you have one week from the time the assignment is handed back to request a regrade. To request a regrade, you must submit the assignment with a written description of your concern attached to the instructor. 
</ul>
<p>
                                                                            

<b>Laboratory Policies</b>
<p> You are expected to attend your assigned lab period every week and to finish 
  the lab assignment in the alloted time. <b> You must finish the assignment by the demo deadline, or you will lose up to 
  30% of your lab grade.</b> All negotiations concerning lab absences due to plant 
  trips or sickness are to be conducted with your lab TA. For plant trips 
  you must notify your instructor in advance.
<p> Lab work will be in groups of 2 or 3. Both members are expected to become proficient 
  with all aspects of the lab. Where each has prepared design work or code assigned 
  as homework, the group design will involve negotiation. The members of a group 
  may be graded differentially if it becomes obvious that one person is doing 
  the bulk of the work.
<p><strong>Academic Conduct</strong>
<p>Each student in this course is expected to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. For this course, collaboration is allowed between partners in a group. <em>Students agree that by   taking this course all required papers may be subject to submission for   textual similarity review to Turnitin.com for the detection of   plagiarism. All submitted papers will be included as   source documents in the Turnitin.com reference database solely for the   purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers. Use of Turnitin.com   service is subject to the Usage Policy posted on the Turnitin.com site.</em> Course   materials posted on the web are intellectual property belonging to   the author.  Students are not permitted to buy or sell any course materials without the express permission of the instructor.  Such unauthorized behavior constitutes academic misconduct<br>

<p>

<b>Laboratory Reports</b>
<p> Each laboratory assignment requires a written report. You will submit a single 
  report for your group.  The report should be submitted as a pdf to your TA. 
<p>
The report should be a concise documentation of the project assigned.
The presentation should be arranged so that any reader with technical
competence in the subject can easily understand what was done and how
it was done.  The following report organization is suggested:
<ol>
	
  <li> Introduction: Give a short explanation of what was done. 
  <li>Describe the role of the ARM and FPGA sides in your design  
  <li>RTL level description of your project and any relevant state machines.
  <li> Design and Testing Methods: Explain the approach you used for both software 
    and hardware aspects of the assignment. Be sure to include the design of tests 
    whose outcome are convincing to the reader (or to the instructor in the lab) 
    that the requirements of the assignment have been met. 
  <li>Results: Screen shots, videos, sound recordings, frequency analysis or what ever is necessary to document the functioning of your project.
  <li>Documentation: Include here drawings and program listings, together with 
    any explanatory comments needed. 
  <li> Answers to specific questions given in the lab writeups.

	  
  <li>Comments: This optional section is for any comments the authors may wish 
    to make concerning the assignment, including suggestions for improvement, 
    excuses, and complaints. The purpose of this section is to encourage the writer 
    to make the other sections clear, concise and understandable, and to reserve 
  this section for creative comments.   
</ol>
<p>A couple of example reports are from Idan Beck (<a href="StudentWork/idan/Lab1Report_2003.doc">1</a>, <a href="StudentWork/idan/Lab3ReportPDF_docx.pdf">2</a>). Further clarification:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Talk during your videos and explain everything that you are doing.   Pretend that we are checking you off and walk through all of the specs.</li>
  <li>Add a work distribution section to your reports detailing everyone's individual contributions.</li>
  <li>Include a testing section which details individual unit tests that   you have used to test each spec. Include Modelsim results as well.</li>
  <li> State machine or flowchart detailing overall program flow.   Description of integration of all of the individual components of your   work, especially systems communicating between the HPS and FPGA.</li>
  <li>Qsys layout description, including all of the modules that your   used and their function. Describe the use of Qsys for integration with   the HPS program.</li>
  <li>Indent and comment your code.</li>
  <li>Concluding remarks about the lab, anything that you would have done differently. </li>
  <li>Include a results section that clearly specifies the specs for the   lab and how you met them. <br>
  Quantify these results if possible, otherwise   include images and diagrams.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<b>Access to computers</b>
<p> You and your partner will have use of a PC, FPGA evaluation board, 
  and peripheral breadboard in Phillips 238 during your assigned lab period.
  Students  from other lab periods may use setups not needed by students attending
  their  assigned lab. <i> Machines are set up to erase all user info when you logout. You should always 
  back up all your work. There is no excuse for lost work, even if it is because 
  of a compiler or other system error.</i>
