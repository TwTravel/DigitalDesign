      <p> <span class="text">Overall, our ray tracer performed much better than 
        expected. We believe our renderings look very impressive. By using spheres 
        and planes, we can create very impressive scenes, especially with high 
        levels of reflections and anti-aliasing. Because we used nearly every 
        logic element on the FPGA, we were unable to instantiate multiple tracers 
        or pipeline our giant state machine. This severely limited our frame rate; 
        however, drawing a few bouncing spheres on the 320x240 resolution with 
        4x anti-aliasing and full reflections still ran at a reasonable rate. 
        We felt that adding anti-aliasing, reflections, and planes were a better 
        use of the hardware resources than pipelining our design, and the realistic 
        renderings we were able to produce support this. While the tracer draws 
        slowly on the complicated scenes with many objects, there are no visible 
        artifacts on the screen. </span></p>
      <p class="text">Another feature we tried to add but wasn't successful was 
        to have the DE2 board interface with a PS/2 mouse, and use the mouse to 
        control the rotation of the camera view instead of using switches. This 
        should have been a very simple design to implement. However the DE2 board 
        and the manual gave conflicting information on whether if it can actually 
        interface with a mouse. When we tried to connect a mouse to the DE2 board 
        it showed no sign of detecting any hardware, while when a keyboard is 
        pluged in it worked fine. </p>
      <p class="text">In this lab we learnt a great deal about ray tracing and 
        programing FPGA as well as NIOS II in general. Another important aspect 
        of this project is doing fixed point arthmetic in FPGA. We also pushed 
        the FPGA to its limit as far as number of logic elements go in our final 
        design. There is room to optimize both for speed and size in our design 
        for future work. </p>
      <p><span class="text">Future Work:<br>
        -Add triangular polygon detection to the plane hardware<br>
        -Use multiple FPGA's to increase frame rate<br>
        -Pipeline the design on a larger FPGA to increase frame rate</span></p>
