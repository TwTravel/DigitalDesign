						<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.16082813125103712">Our project derives ideas from the classic breakout game. In the game, there is a layer of bricks located on the top of the screen, a moveable paddle on the bottom, and a ball travelling across the screen. The objective of the game is to use the paddle to bounce the ball back up every time it falls down so that eventually the ball will break all the bricks. In our version, however, the game can be controlled with hand motions. Specifically, the player can move his hand left, right, up, or down to control the paddle accordingly. In addition to this, the player is allowed to accelerate or decelerate the ball by moving his hand up or down, respectively. To add complexity to the game, we do not let the brick disappear right away when the ball hits it. Instead, the color of the brick fades away in each collision and the brick eventually disappears when the seventh collision occurs. We also added sound effects to make the game more interesting.</p>
