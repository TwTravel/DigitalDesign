<big>Conclusion</big>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><big>This was a very
exciting project for me
to work on because it was well aligned with my interests. The outcome
exceeds all my expectations. I put a lot work into this project to make
it successful and it was well worth it. I would not do things
differently if I had another chance. There are no regrets. However,
it would have been nice to try to push the rate up to an impressive
100 or 120 million k/s by phase locking to a high frequency. Having
the design work the very first time was more than I could have asked
for. </big></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><big><br />
</big></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><big>There were a
couple of lessons I
learned when designing <font color="#ff3366">[</font><font color="#000000">Red</font><font color="#ff3366">]
</font><font color="#000000">. The first is that the
timing
simulation in Quartus is very particular. I had recompiled a design
and the simulation results were not showing up correctly. It turned
out that the simulator could not properly determine values because
the waveforms were not correctly setup. More specifically, I had
recompiled the module to include additional ports but did not add
them to the waveform. The simulator did not find the inputs and the
resulting simulation was wrong even though the logic was correct.
It was very costly in terms of time. </font>
</big></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><big><br />
</big></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><big><font color="#000000">I learned this
next lesson two times. While simulating, I again could not figure out
why the output was incorrect when I was certain everything else was
fine. Countless hours later, I discovered that the input clock was
too fast for the logic to produce correct results. The lesson
learned: use an appropriate clock.</font></big></p>
