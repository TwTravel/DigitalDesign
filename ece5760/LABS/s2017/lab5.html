<h2> ECE 5760: Laboratory 5 </h2> 
<h2> Design project. </h2>

<b> Introduction. </b> 
<p> For this exercise, we want you to pick a project, then design and build it. 
  During this period there will be no other assignments, so we expect you to spend 
  all of your time for this course on the project. You will be expected to be 
  in lab at the usual times and to show significant progress each week of the 
  project.
<p>Grading:
<ul>
  <li> Grades will be assigned by rank-ordering all projects in all sections, thus you will be competing against everyone in the class for this grade. </li>
  <li>20%<b></b> of your project grade depends upon being prepared each week and  on the quality, quantity and character of the work done during each week.  <br>
  Each week in lab a one-page progress report may be due.</li>
  <li> 30% depends on the project demonstration at the end of classes. </li>
  <li>50% will be based on your project writeup. </li>
  <li>The members 
      of a group <em>may be graded differentially</em> if it becomes obvious to the staff that 
      one person is doing the bulk of the work. </li>
</ul>
<p> When choosing a project you will need to consider availability of hardware,
   time available, and your programming skill. You may want 
  to look at several of the links on the 5760 home page for project ideas. 
<b><hr>
Procedure:</b> 
<p> Depends on what you will build. There are some <a href="../../FinalProjects/ProjectIdeas.htm">ideas available</a>. You should talk often to your lab instructor. 
  You can use any combination of Verilog, Qsys, and an operating system.  If you intend to hook hardware to the DE1-SoC expansion connectors, you must get explicit permission. 
<p></p>
<hr>
<b> Assignment </b> 
<p>  You will be graded on several aspects of the project: 
<ol>
  <li> Appropriate level of hardware/software complexity. 
  <li>Appropriate use of external hardware, Verilog generated hardware, C, and HPS. <br>
  <li> A project which works according to specification (which you will write). 
  <li> Level of effort and organization shown in lab.  
  <li> A demonstration of the final project during the<b><font color="#FF0000"> 
    last regular scheduled lab period of the semester</font></b>. 
  <li> Completeness and understandability of the final report. The html report <font color="#000000"><strong>must be emailed to the instructor</strong> (see instructions below) at the date/time specified by the University for this class (not known until finals are announced). The web page will consist of one folder with exactly one html file with the file name <code>index.html</code>. In the folder there may be Verilog source files, c-source files, images, mpegs, zipped projects, or other supporting documents linked to the one html file. <strong>When posting code, you must comply with all Altera IP considerations. </strong></font>  
  <li>You may<em> optionally opt-in</em> for inclusion of  your project on
    the course page. <em><br>
      This a new CORNELL requirement!</em><br>
  <strong>You will automatically lose 2 points on your project if you do not include this!</strong><br>
  <span class="xyzzy"><strong>In the final report, Appendix A <br>
  <em>One of two sentences!</em><br>
    Either: &quot;<em>The group approves this report for inclusion on the course website.</em>&quot;<br>
    Or: 
    &quot;<em>The group does not approve this report for inclusion on the course website.</em>&quot;</strong></span><br>
    If you will ever be asking me for a recommendation, I suggest that you opt-in your project. <br>
    The project web pages help me remember the details of a project and person. </li>
  <li>I will submit student videos to YouTube for inclusion on the <a href="../../../../../../www.youtube.com/user/ece4760">ece5760 channel</a>, if you opt-in. <em><br>

              <li>program details. What parts were tricky to write?</li>
              <li>hardware details. Could someone else build this based on what you

              <li>Be sure to specifically reference any design or code you used from 
                someone else.</li>

                  <li>Intellectual property considerations. 
                    <ul>
                      <li> Did you reuse code or someone else's design? Did you use any of Altera's IP? </li>
                      <li>Did you use code in the public domain?</li>
                      <li>Are you reverse-engineering a design? How did you deal with 
                        patent/trademark issues?</li>
                      <li>Did you have to sign non-disclosure to get a sample part?</li>
                      <li> Are there patent opportunites for your project?</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>Legal considerations. For instance, if you use a transmitter, you must discuss 
                    the appropriate FCC legal restrictions. </li>

<strong>Your web page <font color="#FF0000">must be submitted</font> for grading, and optionally posted on the class project page.<br>
</strong>  To do this:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Put all of your web page files in one directory. Name this directory with the concantented netids of all the group members, e.g., <code>brl4_rw88</code><br>
    Since the pages will be on a UNIX server, you should: 
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the cases (upper/lower) of all filenames agree with their 
        hyperlinks. </li>
      <li>Use only alphanumeric characters and underscores in filenames (NO SPACES, no punctuation of any kind). </li>
      <li>Check all your links to make sure they are relative to your main page. </li>
      <li>Use a directory name consisting of the group's concantenated netids.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ZIP the directory. </li>
  <li>Send it to your partner's computer to see if it renders correctly.</li>
  <li>email it to BRL4@cornell.edu. <br>
  Or if it is too big, send it via dropbox at https://dropbox.cornell.edu/</li>
